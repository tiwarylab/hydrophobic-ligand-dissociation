GROAMCS and PLUMED run files for the paper "Thermodynamically inspired machine-learned reaction coordinates for hydrophobic ligand dissociation"

The folder "methane" contains all the run files required to reproduce the simulations and generate the COLVAR files analyzed in the paper for the methane unbinding simulation. The analogous is true for the "fullerene" folder.
